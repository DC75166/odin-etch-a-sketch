# odin-etch-a-sketch
This is the pre-final project of the odin fundamentals series. It requires, html, css and intermediate js knowledge.
The code creates a 16*16 basic square grid which can be modified according to user input.If the user inputs i, the grid will be i * i squares. Once the user hovers over the squares, the squares will turn black or change colour, basically like a sketchpad.
